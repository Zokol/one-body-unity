Unity tutorial for simulating Newton's law of universal gravitation

![](demo.gif)

Goal of this simulation is to investigate Unity's limitations for large scale physics models.

In the end, the scale of Earth and Moon is too large for Unity to handle with basic units. Thus the model is implemented at scale of 1/100.

Otherwise, the simulation draws an elliptical route around the heavier object, roughly illustrating the gravitation theory from Isaac Newton.
